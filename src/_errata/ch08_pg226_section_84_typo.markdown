The opening line to section 8.4 has a few typos. The sentence should
read as below.

> Unlike the templates for creating or updating `Tag` objects, the
  template for deleting `Tag` objects doesn’t need any information from
  the user and therefore doesn’t need to display `TagForm`.

Thanks to Jonathan Friedman for catching this.
