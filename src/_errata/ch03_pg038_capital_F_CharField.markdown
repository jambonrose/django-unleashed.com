title: Capital F in `CharField`
slug: capital_f_charfield

chapter: 3

The second paragraph on page 38 refers to Django's `CharField` multiple
times. In once instance, the field is mistakenly printed as `Charfield`
- the *F* should be captialized to properly refer to the Python class
(as Python variables are case-sensitive).

Thanks to Jonathan Friedman for catching this.
